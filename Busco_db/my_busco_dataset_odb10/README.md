# Custom BUSCO Dataset: `my_busco_dataset_odb10`

This folder contains all necessary components for a custom BUSCO lineage dataset generated for unicellular holozoans. It is structured to be compatible with the BUSCO framework (version ≥5) and can be used to assess genome completeness with this custom lineage.

## Contents

| File/Folder               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dataset.cfg`             | Metadata and paths used internally by BUSCO to load the lineage.             |
| `id_mapping.tsv`          | Maps BUSCO gene names (e.g., HOGs) to numeric IDs required by BUSCO.         |
| `lengths_cutoff`          | Defines acceptable alignment length ranges for each BUSCO based on ungapped sequence length (±20%). |
| `scores_cutoff`           | Minimum acceptable HMMER score per BUSCO profile, determined from reference alignments using `hmmsearch`. |
| `hmms/`                   | Directory containing raw `.hmm`, `.fa`, and `.aln` files per BUSCO gene (used to build the final HMM). |
| `myholozoa.hmm`           | Final concatenated HMM file of all BUSCO gene models.                        |
| `myholozoa.hmm.h3i/h3m/h3f/h3p` | Index files generated by `hmmpress` for HMMER to efficiently search the concatenated HMM database. |

## Usage

Once this folder is complete, you can run BUSCO with the `--lineage_dataset` flag pointing to this directory:

```bash
busco -i your_fasta -o busco_output -l my_busco_dataset_odb10 -m prot --cpu 4 --offline -f
